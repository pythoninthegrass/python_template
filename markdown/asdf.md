#### Debugging
**No version set for command python**
* Make sure `python` or `python3` isn't aliased in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

[bash - Is it possible to check where an alias was defined? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/322459/is-it-possible-to-check-where-an-alias-was-defined/544970#544970)

##### PATH
* `asdf`, `poetry`, and `python` all need to be sourced in your shell `$PATH` in a specific order
  * `asdf` stores its Python shims in `~/.asdf/shims`
  * `poetry` lives in `~/.local/bin`
    ```bash
    export ASDF_DIR="$HOME/.asdf"
    export PATH="$ASDF_DIR/shims:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
    ```
* Furthermore, any aliases or alias files need to be sourced as well
    ```bash
    . "$ASDF_DIR/asdf.sh"
    . "$ASDF_DIR/completions/asdf.bash"
    . /usr/local/etc/profile.d/poetry.bash-completion
    ```
